# Oracle Database Sails/Waterline Adapter

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-oradb.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails-oradb) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/baitic/sails-oradb.png)](https://gemnasium.com/baitic/sails-oradb)

A [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) adapter for Oracle Database that uses the Official Node Oracle Driver (v1.3.0) mantained by Oracle Corp.  May be used in a [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) app or anything using Waterline for the ORM.

## Â¡Important advice!

The Adapter is not finished yet. It has few functionalities pending for fixes, but you can use it. It works on both Windows and Linux systems.

Things that you can do NOW:

- Connect to an Oracle database. (05/Aug/2015)
- Do find request. (05/Aug/2015)
- Populate find request (Joins). (07/Aug/2015)
- Create, modify and delete automatically DB tables (Alter mode). (07/Aug/2015)
- Insert request. (11/Aug/2015)
- Update request. (22/Aug/2015)
- Delete request. (22/Aug/2015)
- Use multiple Oracle connections on Sails App. (22/Aug/2015)

Pending fixes:

- On alter mode, create automatically triggers and sequences for autoincrementable attributes. Now you must create them manually.
- The PK column must be id.
- Now in updates you must use id on where clause.
- Count request.
- On alter mode, allow the automatic addition and deletion of table columns individually.
- On alter mode, implement createEach method.
- On insert autoincrementable attribute value, set its sequence if necessary.

From now you can work with this adapter using funcionalities as described. 

We hope we can improve adapter actions as soon as posible.
