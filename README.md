# Oracle Database Sails/Waterline Adapter

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-oradb.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails-oradb) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/baitic/sails-oradb.png)](https://gemnasium.com/baitic/sails-oradb)

A [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) adapter for Oracle Database that uses the Node Oracle Driver mantained by Oracle Corp.  May be used in a [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) app or anything using Waterline for the ORM.

## Â¡Important advice!

The Adapter is not finished yet. It only has implemented few functionalities for testing purposes. 

Things that you can do NOW:

- Connect to an Oracle database. (05/Aug/2015)
- Do find request. (05/Aug/2015)
- Populate find request (Joins). (07/Aug/2015)
- Create, modify and delete automatically DB tables (Alter mode). (07/Aug/2015)
- Insert request. (11/Aug/2015)

ToDo List:

- Update request.
- Delete request.
- Count request.
- Improvements:
    - On alter mode, allow the automatic addition and deletion of table columns individually.
    - On alter mode, implement createEach method.
    - On alter mode, create automatically triggers and sequences for autoincrementable attributes.
    - On insert autoincrementable attribute value, set its sequence if necessary.
    - Allow using multiple Oracle connections in application.
- More.

Notice:

- The automatic addition of new collumns for existing tables is not working properly yet.
- Autoincrement for a primary key is not implemented automatically when a table is created. You must do it manually for the moment.


Main functionalities like update and delete will be done as soon as posible!
